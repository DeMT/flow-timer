A modified timer of the Pomodoro technique, with a lot of useless CSS animation for the practice purpose.  

Note that to use this timer efficiently, users should try to prolong the session gradually, and immerse oneself for 30-50 mins at the later sessions to fortify the flow experience. Take breaks as needed, but stay longer each time into sessions.  
The recommandded starting time is 4 Pomodoro sessions or 1hr 40 mins.
